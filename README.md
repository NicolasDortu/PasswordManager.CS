My first (unfinished) attempt at making a password manager to learn about C#, .NET, and Visual Studio. <br>
The encrypting is made based on the main password setup at the first launch of the app. the main password is the decryption key for the other passwords stored in the sqlite database. (So it's not stored in the database) <br>
I'll keep using real password manager and not this one but it was nice to do lol <br>
